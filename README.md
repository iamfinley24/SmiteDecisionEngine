Team picker for smite based on preferences

This is a small project to pick a Smite team for ranked matches. 

The criteria:
Take player preferences in dynamically.
Build god list based off some sort of file.
remove banned gods from sorting logic
follow team choices according to ranked pick order
suggest a valid team comp, based on countering enemy team as well as personal player preferences

The idea is to have it all set up so that you only have to mark the chosen bans and gods during the god picking timer.
